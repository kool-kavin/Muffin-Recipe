1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375Â°F. Line a standard 12-well muffin pan with papers liners or coat the wells with cooking spray.

2. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl; set aside. 

3. Whisk the milk, oil, egg, and vanilla if using together in a medium bowl until combined.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until just combined. Some lumps are fine.

5. If you're adding mix-ins to your muffins, fold in the fruit, chocolate chips, or nuts gently until distributed. Four or five folds is all it should take.

6. Divide the batter amongst the prepared muffin wells, about 1/3 cup of batter per well. Bake until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
